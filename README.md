# Web-based-Image-Analyzer

The directory style is same as this repo : https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo2
All the requirements are based on this repo as well.


The output of the porgram will be similar to this : https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html

It will be a open-cv window which continously displays frames. Zhixiang you need to figure out how to take that frame and upload it to your server. 
The final predict.py file is still under modification and will be updated in an hour.
